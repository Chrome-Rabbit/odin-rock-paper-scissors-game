# Rock, Paper, Scissors - Browser Console Edition

## Overview
This is a Rock, Paper, Scissors game built with JavaScript. It runs in the browser console and involves a player competing against a computer to reach 5 points. The project uses HTML and JavaScript. Use F12 and select console in the browser's developer tools.

## Features
- **HTML**: Includes a basic structure with a `<script>` tag to run the JavaScript.
- **JavaScript**: Uses functions, conditionals, loops, and variables to manage gameplay. The computerâ€™s choice is randomized with `Math.random()`. Input is handled with `prompt()`, and output is shown via `console.log()`.
- **Console-Based**: The game operates entirely in the browser console.
- **Git**: Commits follow a consistent version control process.

## Personal Reflection
I built this to practice JavaScript logic. The `switch` statement in `playRound()` was challenging due to a misplaced `return` and some faulty logic, but I fixed it. That did take some time to process due to my greenness of course. I chose a console-only design to focus on the code as The Odin Project dictated. This project shows my ability to handle logic and interactivity. Javascript documentation was a game changer for me after going through this project and I look forward to using it more in the future.
